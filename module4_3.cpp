What is the difference between OOP and POP?

==> Basic Definition :	OOP is object-oriented OR POP is structure or procedure-oriented.

===> Program Division :	OOP is divided into objects OR	POP is divided into functions.

===>Approach : OOP is Bottom-Up approach OR POP Is	Top-down approach

===>Data Control : Data in OOP each object is controlled on its own. OR IN POP Every function has different data, so there’s no control over it.

===>Entity Linkage : OOP In Object functions are linked through message passing. OR In POP Parts of a program are linked through parameter passing.

==>Expansion : IN OOP Adding new data and functions is easy  OR IN POP Expanding data and function is not easy.

===>Inheritance : IN OOP	Inheritance is supported in three modes: public, private & protected  OR IN POP Inheritance is not supported.

===>Access control : IN OOP Access control is done with access modifiers OR IN POP No access modifiers supported.

===>Data Hiding : IN OOP Data can be hidden using Encapsulation No data hiding OR IN POP Data is accessible globally.

===>Overloading or Polymorphism : IN OOP Overloading functions, constructors, and operators are done OR IN POP Overloading is not possible.

===>Friend function : IN OOP Classes or functions can be linked using the keyword “friend, only in C++. OR IN POP No friend function.

==>Virtual classes or functions : IN OOP The virtual function appears during inheritance OR IN POP No virtual classes or functions.

===>Code Reusability : IN OOP The existing code can be reused. OR IN POP No code reusability.

===>Problem Solving : OOP solving big problems  OR POP	Not suitable for solving big problems.

===>Example : OOP-	C++, JAVA, VB.NET, C#.NET. OR  POP- C, VB, FORTRAN, Pascal
